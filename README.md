Overview
--------

`coverme` acts as a backup data aggregator, it grabs data from different sources and uploads it to Amazon Glacier or Amazon S3. More storage options will be probably available. You're always welcome to fork and make a pull request ;)

* Requires Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+ installed
* Should work on Linux/MacOS/FreeBSD
* Supports MySQL backups via `mysqldump`
* Supports PostgreSQL backups via `pg_dump`
* Supports directory archive

Also for Amazon services configuration you may need to install AWS command line utility `awscli`.

Install
-------

Install via pip:

```
pip install coverme
```

or if only Python 3.x pip is available: 

```
pip3 install coverme
```

If you're going to use Amazon services for backup, you'll also need to set up credentials via `aws configure` or manually, see [Tips on Amazon services setup](#tips-on-amazon-services-setup).

Basic usage
-----------

Just to make sure that installation is correct run:

```
coverme --help
```

**Please note!** Examples below probably do not provide best security practices! Intermediate backups are stored in shared `/tmp` dir and backups are not encrypted before upload.

1. Define your backup rules in JSON or YAML config, e.g. `backup.yml`:

    ```yaml
    ---
    defaults:
        # tmpdir: base directory for temporary files
        tmpdir: /tmp
        # cleanup: remove archive after upload or not, default: no
        cleanup: yes
        # localdir: optional, directory for local backups
        localdir: backups
        # format: optional, default: zip
        format: gztar

    backups:
      - type: database
        url: postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/test
        to: [bucket1]
        name: postgres-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}--{HH}-{MM}.sql
        # tags: optional, no default
        tags: myapp, postgres, db

      - type: database
        url: mysql://root@127.0.0.1/test
        to: [bucket1]
        name: mysql-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}--{HH}-{MM}.sql
        # tags: optional, no default
        tags: myapp, mysql, db

      - type: dir
        path: /home/myapp/var/www/uploads
        to: [glacier1]
        name: myapp-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}--{HH}-{MM}
        # format: optional, default: zip
        format: gztar
        # tags: optional, no default
        tags: myapp, uploads

    vaults:
      bucket1:
        service: s3
        region: eu-west-1
        account: NNNNNNNNNNNN
        name: coverme-test

      glacier1:
        service: glacier
        region: eu-west-1
        account: NNNNNNNNNNNN
        name: coverme-test
    ...
    ```

2. Perform test backup using config file `backup.yml`:

    ```
    coverme backup -c backup.yml
    ```

    If some configutaion error happen, fix it first. For example, may you have to configure AWS credentials with [`aws configure`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) first.

3. Add `coverme` to cron jobs:

    ```
    crontab -e
    ```

    Make sure to specify full paths to files, because cron jobs are run without PATH environment setting by default:

    ```
    # run coverme backups every day at 5:30
    30 5 * * * /usr/local/bin/coverme backup -c /home/myapp/backup.yml
    ```

    Real path to `coverme` may be different depending on installation, to get proper full path run:

    ```
    which coverme
    ```

Questions and answers
---------------------

### How to provide PostgreSQL password for `pg_dump`?

Use `~/.pgpass` file with `600` permissions, see details here:  
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html

### Why `tags` field is required for `backups` definition?

It should be optional, so it's a bug and will be fixed. For current release please just leave it empty.
